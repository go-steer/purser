# dev/

Build- and test-tooling. The same scripts power both local development and
GitHub Actions CI, so a green local run is the same green run as remote.

## Quickstart

```bash
# Run every CI check locally (fast-fail order).
dev/tools/ci

# Run all checks even after a failure (collect every problem at once).
dev/tools/ci --keep-going

# Auto-fix formatting (gofmt + goimports).
dev/tools/fix-go-format
```

Missing tools (`golangci-lint`, `goimports`, `govulncheck`, `apidiff`)
auto-install into `$GOBIN` (or `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`) on first use. No setup
needed beyond a Go toolchain.

## Adding a check

1. Drop a new script under `dev/tools/<name>` (executable, `set -euo pipefail`,
   sources `common.sh`).
2. Add it to the `STEPS` array in `dev/tools/ci`.
3. Add a one-line delegator under `dev/ci/presubmits/<name>` that
   `exec`s the tool script.

That's it. The `ci` workflow runs `dev/tools/ci`, so a new step is picked up
without touching any YAML — the delegator exists so the step can also be run
on its own, and so nothing in a workflow ever has to know what a check does.

## CI on PRs

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the whole sweep in one `ci` job on every push
to `main` and every PR. No path filters, deliberately: a required status check
on a path-filtered workflow never reports on a PR the filter excludes, and
GitHub parks that PR on "Expected — Waiting for status" forever. The Go
pipeline here is seconds, so docs-only PRs simply run it too.

`apidiff` is its own workflow rather than a step in that job, for two reasons:
it needs `fetch-depth: 0` to see the baseline tag, which the main job should
not pay for; and it is deliberately **not** a required check. It depends on a
tag being fetchable, so a mirror hiccup or a moved tag would turn into a red
required check on unrelated PRs. Its verdict is visible on every PR; promote
it to required once it has a release cycle of clean history behind it.

`ci.yml` sets `PURSER_CI_SKIP=apidiff` so the aggregator omits the step that
runs in that separate job. The step list itself stays in one place —
`dev/tools/ci` — so the local sweep cannot drift from the remote one.

Branch protection on `main` requires:

- `ci`
- `review-gate`

## review-gate

`.github/workflows/review-gate.yml` fails any PR that touches `.go` files
whose body has no "Adversarial review" section. It is the tool-agnostic
backstop behind the convention in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) "How we develop";
`dev/claude/settings-review-gate.json` is an opt-in local hook that catches the
same thing before CI ever sees it. Docs-only and bot PRs are exempt.

## License headers

Every source file carries the full Apache 2.0 header at the top, attributed to
Google LLC:

```
// Copyright 2026 Google LLC
//
// Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the "License");
// you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

```

(`#`-prefixed for shell, YAML, and Python.) The `goheader` linter inside
`dev/tools/lint-go` enforces this on every `.go` file — CI fails if a new Go
source is missing it. For shell, YAML, and Python files, run
`dev/tools/add-license-headers` after creating new ones; the script is
idempotent and normalizes any existing header to the current canonical form.

Its `HEADER_BODY` and the `goheader` template in `dev/tools/.golangci.yml` are
two copies of the same text and drift silently. Change one, change the other,
and run `dev/tools/lint-go` to confirm they still agree.

## Pinned tool versions

| Tool          | Version    | Source                                                     |
|---------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| golangci-lint | v2.12.1    | `dev/tools/lint-go` (`GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION`)              |
| apidiff       | pinned     | `dev/tools/verify-apidiff` (`APIDIFF_VERSION`)             |
| goimports     | latest     | `dev/tools/fix-go-format`, `dev/tools/verify-go-format`    |
| govulncheck   | latest     | `dev/tools/verify-vuln`                                    |

`apidiff` is pinned to a pseudo-version because `golang.org/x/exp` carries no
tags. It is pinned at all — unlike govulncheck — because its classification of
a change as compatible or incompatible *is* the gate; letting it float would
let an upstream reclassification turn a green PR red with no local diff to
explain it.

Bump deliberately — new linter releases can introduce findings that block CI.
When you bump golangci-lint, run `dev/tools/lint-go` locally first to fix
anything new before pushing.
